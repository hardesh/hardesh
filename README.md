### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Robotics Engineer at Peppermint Robots, working on autonomous cleaning robots.

I graduated from BITS Pilani, Goa in Dec 2020. For my bachelor's thesis, I worked on motion planning of aerial robots for exploration and visual search of 
geometrically constrained environments such as mines and caves, under the guidance of 
[Prof. Kostas Alexis](http://www.kostasalexis.com/). 

I'm currently interested in motion planning, perception and RL.
