### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an undergraduate student from BITS Pilani, Goa. I like building robots ðŸ¤–.

I am currently working on motion planning of aerial robots
that can be deployed in geometrically constrained environments such as mines and caves, under the guidance of 
[Prof. Kostas Alexis](http://www.kostasalexis.com/). 

In my free time, I'm learning about object detection and reinforcement learning.
